## Installation: 
The codes .m files in this repository run on any Matlab environment. The .pdf figures can open on any device that support .pdf documents. 

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is develop a Monte Carlo suite of forward models of magnetic anomalies patterned after the mantle portions of the Siberian craton, the Hawai'i hotspot, and the French Massif Central plume.   I utilized data of magnetic properties measured from rocks collected in the said regions as documented in Ferre et al. Two important research questions were answered:
1. Is the mantle contribution to satelite magnetic anomalies significant enough for consideration in interpreting satelite signals?.
2. Should Moho be considered as a magnetic boundry between magnetic crust and non-magnetic mantle ?

## File Descriptions:
The dataset utilized for this study are obtained from Ferre et al. 2013, and thus publicly available. The datasets include remanent magnetization and magnetic succesptibilities of rocks from Siberia, Hawaii, and Massif Central. 

## Results: 
The findings of this study are summarized in the scientific paper published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920118301444?via%3Dihub)
